Me, a Mirror is a novel I've been working on since October 2021. As a very brief summary, it's a story about an aspiring painter falling in love with an eccentric musician, and the changes the two go through as this happens. It takes place in Colorado around the 2010s.

I'm pretty sure this is the first non-fantasy story I've ever written, and it's also the one I'm proudest of. Of course every writer is proudest of their most recent work, but this is undoubtedly the story I've worked on for the longest time. I've rewritten it from scratch a few times already, each time having come up with a better idea for the overall plot. At the moment I'm working on an organized outline for the story before a final rewrite.

The main theme of the story is the disassociation of oneself from themself. Which I guess is a fancy way of saying, "the loss of a sense of self." This is something the protagonist went through throughout her life, and which she learns to fight over the course of the story.
