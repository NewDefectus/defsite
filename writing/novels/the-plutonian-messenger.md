The Plutonian Messenger is a novel I wrote between November 2017 and August 2018. It's set in the far future during a nuclear winter, caused by (I think) unknown circumstances. It's written as an allegory about and criticism of organized religion.

I've included The Plutonian Messenger on this website mostly for completeness's sake; it's not something I'm particularly proud of, but I figure putting it up online can't do any harm. Just know that before you take a read of it (hell, maybe someone'll get a kick out of it somehow). Also, you'll notice that I've tagged this as UNFINISHED; the novel itself is complete, but originally there were plans to write a second draft which never came to fruition. Anyway since I don't plan on ever officially publishing it (or anything resembling it), I'm considering this work abandoned.

Here's an attached .docx file of the novel if you wanna have a look:
