These are the Minecraft adventure maps I published under the name Defectus. These were released between 2016 and 2017.

I won't go too much into the reasons behind the name change, but to summarize, I was displeased with the persona I'd created under the SpakeMiner moniker and decided that, moving forward, I wanted to change that name to disassociate my future works from the past ones. More specifically, I'd gotten into a heated debate with the Minecraft map making community which kind of tarnished this old name, so I figured moving forward I should change it.

Anyway, I published much fewer maps as Defectus than as SpakeMiner, but they were much better. If the SpakeMiner maps were quantity, the Defectus maps were quality.
