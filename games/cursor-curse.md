Cursor Curse was a 2D puzzle game I wrote in [Unity](https://unity.com/) around late 2017. The idea was that you controlled a Windows-style cursor on a screen and navigated through obstacles, with the final goal of each level being to press a red button (or a set of red buttons simultaneously, since for some levels you control multiple cursors).

At some point I either lost interest in the project or just ran out of ideas for levels, I'm not sure exactly. I do have some videos left over from when I was developing it:
