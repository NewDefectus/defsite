This is a [Mandelbrot viewer](https://github.com/NewDefectus/mandelbrot) I wrote in JavaScript between late 2018 and early 2019. It's designed for smooth exploration and customization. I've attached an iframe of it down below (full page can be found [here](https://newdefectus.github.io/mandelbrot/)).

Click and drag (or use arrow keys) to move around the plane; use the mouse wheel (or use +/-, or pinch if you're on a touchscreen) to zoom in and out. You can open the settings menu with the button on the top-right corner, where you can adjust the iteration count, resolution, and color scheme. Right-clicking (double-tapping on touchscreens) on the plane "selects" a point on it, and you can find information on why it's inside or outside the Mandelbrot set in the top left corner.

For more information I recommend reading the [README.md](https://github.com/NewDefectus/mandelbrot#readme) file on the GitHub repository.
